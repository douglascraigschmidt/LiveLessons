This folder contains source code and a gradle project for a
command-line app that reimplements the
[SearchTaskGang](https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/LiveLessons/tree/master/SearchTaskGang)
example from my [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/)
LiveLessons tutorial to show how modern Java functional programming
features (such as lambdas, method references, sequential and parallel
streams, completable futures, as well as the Java 7 fork-join
framework) can be applied to search for words in a list of input data
strings. This app also compares and contrasts the performance of many
different concurrency and parallelism models, including the RxJava and
Project Reactor implementation of Java's reactive streams model.
