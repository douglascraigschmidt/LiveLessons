This directory contains Java source code examples from my [immersive
courses at
Vanderbilt](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/courses.html) and
my Live Training courses.  Here's an overview of what's included:

. Async -- This example combines the Java completable futures
  framework with the Java sequential streams framework to process
  entries in a recursively-structured folder hierarchy concurrently.

. ForkJoin -- This example shows how to use various Java mechanisms
  (including the Java fork-join pool framework and sequential/parallel
  Streams framework) to count the number of files in a (large)
  recursive folder hierarchy, as well as calculate the cumulative
  sizes of all the files.

. Reactor -- This example shows the use of Project Reactor to process
  entries in a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially
  and concurrently.

. RxJava -- This example shows the use of RxJava to process entries in
  a recursively-structured directory folder sequentially and
  concurrently.

. Streams -- This example shows the use of the Java streams framework
  to process entries in a recursively-structured directory folder
  using the Java sequential and parallel streams frameworks.  It also
  shows how to implement spliterators and collectors for Java
  sequential and parallel streams.

. WebFlux -- This example shows how to use the Spring WebFlux
  framework together with Project Reactor to process entries in a
  large recursive directory folder concurrently as a web service.
