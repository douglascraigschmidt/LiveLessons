## Indicates how much time (in seconds) that the HTTP
## connections to eureka server can stay idle before
## it can be closed. In the AWS environment, it is recommended
## that the values is 30 seconds or less, since the firewall
## cleans up the connection information after a few mins
## leaving the connection hanging in limbo.
##
## eureka.client.eureka-connection-idle-timeout-seconds=30
## Indicates how long to wait (in seconds) before a connection to
## eureka server needs to timeout. Note that the connections in
## the client are pooled by org.apache.http.client.HttpClient and
## this setting affects the actual connection creation and also
## the wait time to get the connection from the pool.
##
## eureka.client.eureka-server-connect-timeout-seconds=5
## Gets the DNS name to be queried to get the list of eureka servers.
## This information is not required if the contract returns the service
## urls by implementing serviceUrls. The DNS mechanism is used when
## useDnsForFetchingServiceUrls is set to true and the eureka client
## expects the DNS to configured a certain way so that it can fetch
## changing eureka servers dynamically. The changes are effective at
## runtime.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-d-n-s-name
## Gets the port to be used to construct the service url to contact
## eureka server when the list of eureka servers come from the DNS.
## This information is not required if the contract returns the
## service urls eurekaServerServiceUrls(String). The DNS mechanism
## is used when useDnsForFetchingServiceUrls is set to true and the
## eureka client expects the DNS to configured a certain way so that
## it can fetch changing eureka servers dynamically. The changes are
## effective at runtime.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-port
## Indicates how long to wait (in seconds) before a read from eureka
## server needs to timeout.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-read-timeout-seconds=8
## Gets the total number of connections that is allowed from eureka
## client to all eureka servers.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-total-connections=200
## Gets the total number of connections that is allowed from eureka
## client to a eureka server host.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-total-connections-per-host=50
## Gets the URL context to be used to construct the service url to
## contact eureka server when the list of eureka servers come from
## the DNS. This information is not required if the contract returns
## the service urls from eurekaServerServiceUrls. The DNS mechanism
## is used when useDnsForFetchingServiceUrls is set to true and the
## eureka client expects the DNS to configured a certain way so that
## it can fetch changing eureka servers dynamically. The changes are
## effective at runtime.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-server-u-r-l-context
## Indicates how often(in seconds) to poll for changes to eureka server
## information. Eureka servers could be added or removed and this
## setting controls how soon the eureka clients should know about it.
##
#eureka.client.eureka-service-url-poll-interval-seconds=0
## Indicates whether or not this instance should try to use the eureka
## server in the same zone for latency and/or other reason. Ideally
## eureka clients are configured to talk to servers in the same zone
## The changes are effective at runtime at the next registry fetch
## cycle as specified by registryFetchIntervalSeconds
##
#eureka.client.prefer-same-zone-eureka=true
## Indicates whether or not this instance should register its information
## with eureka server for eureka by others. In some cases, you do not
## want your instances to be discovered whereas you just want do discover
## other instances.
##
#eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true
#eureka.server.peer-eureka-nodes-update-interval-ms=0
#eureka.server.peer-eureka-status-refresh-time-interval-ms=0
## Enables the use of Eureka with Ribbon.
##
#ribbon.eureka.enabled=true
